# elsigner

This program allows the user to connect to a remote Issuer server,
retrieve the credentials pending for signature, and sign each of them using a local eIDAS certificate.
The default Issuer to which the program connects can be modified using the global options.

The program can also generate a test eIDAS certificate to be used for testing, using the command `create`.
